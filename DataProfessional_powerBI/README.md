# Beginner Power BI Project – Data Professional Survey Dashboard

Hey there!   
This is my **first Power BI guided project** where I learned how to create a clean, interactive dashboard using a survey dataset filled by data professionals.

I used **basic charts, slicers, KPIs**, and a little formatting to tell a story about:
- Who took the survey
- How happy they are with their job
- What programming languages they love
- Their salaries and roles

## Dashboard Preview

Here's what the final dashboard looks like:

## What This Dashboard Shows

 **Total Participants** – How many people answered  
 **Average Age** – The average age of survey takers  
 **Participants by Country** – Where people are from  
 **Average Pay by Gender** – Salary comparison  
 **Job Title vs. Average Pay** – Who earns the most  
 **Most Preferred Programming Language** – Python fans win  
 **Happiness Levels** – With Work-Life Balance & Pay

## What I Learned

As a beginner, this project helped me learn:
- How to import data in Power BI  
- Create visuals like **doughnut charts**, **bar graphs**, and **gauges**  
- Use **slicers** and **cards** for summary metrics  
- Format visuals to make the dashboard readable and nice looking

## Next Steps

Now that I’ve got the hang of it, I’m planning to:
- Try custom visuals  
- Add drill-through pages  
- Clean messy data using Power Query
